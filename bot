	bot: A young male with African ethnicity, approximately in his infancy, is captured in a moment of intense fury. His very lean body is bent over with his back exposed, revealing a stark contrast of a golden ratio tattoo. The scene unfolds within the tight confines of an aircraft cabin, where the intricate bokeh effect of the background lighting casts a dreamy, blurred backdrop. The macro photography captures the high magnification of his enraged expression, with flared nostrils and narrowed eyes, showcasing the raw emotion of the moment. His medium hair is styled in a way that adds to the dramatic scene, with each strand defined in the super close-up. The shot is framed to focus on the tension in his body and the fine details of his skin, leaving the viewer to interpret the cause of his distress amidst the whirl of a defocused environment. The bokeh lights form a mesmerizing pattern that draws the eye to the central figure, while the blurred background elements hint at the unseen chaos that may have provoked his reaction. This intimate image invites the viewer to empathize with the subject's plight, creating a powerful narrative through visual storytelling.
